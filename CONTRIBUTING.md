# Contribution Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to json2netcdf. We very much welcome your input.

## Bug reports

Whilst bug reports are very welcome, we strongly encourage pull requests to accompany these. Reports should be made via the issue tracker and should include enough information to be fully reproducible. This includes information on the system and compiler you are using, as well as detailed information about what you were doing that caused the bug.

## New and updated features

We welcome new and updated features via pull requests. Only completed features that do not require any further coding to become functional will be accepted. If you have an idea for a feature but don't have the time to code it, then consider raising a feature request issue. If you have some code towards a feature but won't have time to finish it, then raise an issue highlighting this, and if we think the feature is valuable enough, we may open a new feature branch for you to submit your code to.

## Which branch?

Please send pull requests for all contributions (bug reports and features) to the `develop` branch.

## Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to Sam Harrison at [samharrison.xg@gmail.com](mailto:samharrison.xg@gmail.com). Please do not submit an issue with the vulnerability.

## Coding style

Please use pep8 and comment your code well. Remember that code is (probably) read more often than it is written.
